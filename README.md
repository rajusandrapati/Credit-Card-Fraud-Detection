Credit Card Fraud Detection:

Overview:

This project focuses on the detection of credit card fraud using machine learning techniques. It involves analyzing a dataset containing credit card transactions and building predictive models to identify fraudulent transactions.

Project Structure:

1. Dataset:
The dataset used for this project is creditcard.csv, which contains transaction data including features like time, transaction amount, and anonymized numerical features (V1-V28) obtained through PCA transformation due to privacy concerns. The target variable is Class, indicating whether a transaction is fraudulent (Class=1) or not (Class=0).

2. Data Preprocessing:
The dataset is loaded using pandas and examined for any missing values or inconsistencies.
Data visualization techniques such as histograms and count plots are utilized to understand the distribution of classes and features.
3. Data Processing:
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset while retaining important information.
Data normalization using Robust Scaler is performed to standardize the features.
4. Model Building:
Two machine learning algorithms are implemented for classification: Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier.
The models are trained on the preprocessed data and evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.
5. Evaluation:
Precision-Recall curves are plotted to visualize the trade-off between precision and recall for both models.
The performance of each model is assessed based on accuracy and other evaluation metrics.
